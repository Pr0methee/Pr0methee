### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pr0methee, I'm now a student at the University of OrlÃ©ans (France ). That's my very frst year here, I'm doing an informatic-mathematics portal, meaning that during this first semester I'm studying both even if next semester I will study a lot of maths compared to informatic.

For me programming is more a hobby than a project of work.
